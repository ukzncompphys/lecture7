If the grid resolution goes up by a factor of 10, then the CFL
stability condition means that, at constant velocity, the step size in
time must decrease by a factor of 10.  To get to the same total time,
we have to take 10 times as many steps over 10 times as many grid
cells, for a total of 100 times more work.
